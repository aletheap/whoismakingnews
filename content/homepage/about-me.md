Hi, I'm Kristen Browde, a parent, lawyer, activist and out transgender woman, living in Miami, Florida. With the help of awesome developer and fellow TikTok member Caleb Crome I set up this site because people wanted to see the data that goes into my TikTok series, [Who's Making News for Sex Crimes involving Children](#tiktok)
