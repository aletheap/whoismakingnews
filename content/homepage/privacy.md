**Privacy policy:** I do not collect any individually identifiable data from visitors to this site.
The site is hosted by {{< extlink href="https://pages.github.com" text="GitHub Pages" >}}, so is subject to their privacy policy.

Google analytics is set up to detect if
  anyone cares enough to look at this data, but I don't keep the data,
  sell the data or use it for anything other than seeing if the site
  gets used enough to make it worthwhile to keep it up. If you use the
  site you consent to whatever data gets collected from you. And if
  you use the site the hosting company may or may not use cookies. If
  it does, I don't know about it or know what, if anything, the
  cookies do. If you continue on the site, you consent to those
  cookies too.
